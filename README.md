# Functional Equivalent of a Maps Application

*Implementing functional equivalent of a maps application (i.e. Google Maps, Yandex Maps etc.). In order to implement such application, Graph and Hash Table data structures will be additionally implemented. Details of these data structures will be explained in the More_information.pdf .


*Keywords: C++, Data Structures, Graphs, Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm, Hash Table, Quadratic Probing
